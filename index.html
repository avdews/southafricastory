				Data will finally fall in South Africa.
			</p>

			<p>
				Three months after the Competition Commission South Africa officially called for the two largest and most reliable telecom companies in South Africa to lower their prices or face prosecution, Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub <a href="https://www.vodacom.com/news-article.php?articleID=7457">announced</a> Tuesday the company’s first step in complying with the Commission's order. The price of the company’s 30-day 1 gigabyte bundle – prepaid quantities of mobile data – will drop 30%, from R149 to R99, starting April 1.
			</p>

			<p>
				Joosub said Vodacom are planning more price cuts for data bundles beginning in April 2021.
			</p>

			<p>
				The telecom companies were originally given a two-month deadline to comply with the order, but in February the Competition Commission announced that enough progress had been made to warrant a one-month extension to comply.
			</p>

			<p>
				The announcement included plans for a new service called “Connect U” that will combine all of the company’s existing data-free services alongside other essential information, such as weather and job portals. The service, referred to as “lifeline data,” satisfies the requirement for telecoms to ensure that all customers have access to data regardless of income, and has the potential to make President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation promise for free data for low-income South Africans one step closer to becoming a reality.
			</p>

			<p>
				The order, and Vodacom’s response, is the culmination of three years of pressure on government agencies. In 2016, #DataMustFall, a grassroots social media campaign petitioning the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) to lower data prices, emerged after outcries over high data prices on Twitter.
			</p> 

			<p>
				One group that took on the issue is <a href="https://www.amandla.mobi/">amandla.mobi,</a> a community advocacy organization that uses cell phones to mobilize people into social action. The organization began petitioning ICASA to limit the amount of profiteering the telecom companies could do and force an investigation of whether or not data prices were competitive. Noxolo Mfocwa, a junior campaigner at amandla.mobi, welcomes the announcement while recognizing that there is still more work to be done.
			</p>

			<p>
				“We are moving in the right direction, but it’s really about forcing the networks to recognize that the people whose lives they should be changing aren’t the ones who can afford R99 a month to buy 1 gigabyte, but actually the people who are buying R10 100 megabyte bundles,” Mfocwa said. “So we are trying to make sure that all these changes also benefit the people at the bottom of the chain, and not just those who can afford bigger bundles.”

			<p>
				In the nation of 58.7 million people, 88% of cell phone users pre-pay for mobile data using bundles, <a href="https://www.icasa.org.za/uploads/files/state-of-ict-sector-report-2019.pdf">according</a> to ICASA. In addition to the amount of data purchased in a bundle, data bundles are also priced based on how long they are valid for – one day, one week, or one month. This type of system, according to Mfocwa, burdens the poor. The longer the bundle is valid for, the cheaper it is, but telecom companies require proof of regular income to be able to purchase monthly bundles. Lower-income South Africans are forced to buy data at the more expensive daily or weekly rates, and often split the data with their families, increasing the number of bundles they must purchase.
			</p>

			<p>
				The median monthly income in South Africa is R1149, below the upper-bound poverty line for the nation of R1227 per month, <a href="https://pmbejd.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/December-2019-Household-Affordability-Index-PMBEJD.pdf">according</a> to the Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice & Dignity Group. In 2018, the average cost of a 1 gigabyte data bundle in South Africa was R101.91, or about 8% of the median monthly income. In the United States, the median monthly income is $2,808.83, <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/income-per-capita-calculation-and-u-s-statistics-3305852">according</a> to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2018, the average cost of 1 gigabyte of data was $12.37, or about 0.4% of the median monthly income.
			</p>

			<p>
				Mfocwa wonders if the Competition Commision and Vodcom’s plan goes far enough. Last August, the government passed legislation to establish national health insurance, with few details about implementation contained in the bill. Since then, official government discussion about implementation has been partially released through podcasts, a data-heavy medium that is not widely used in South Africa because few people can afford to stream or download episodes. Information about the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country has been distributed from government Twitter accounts. Applications for businesses and education are all online. If the government is going to continue to release information this way, Mfocwa said, then the solution to the data problem is equal and reliable access to the internet.
			</p>

			<p>
				“If it means you taking part in all the democratic processes of this country means you need to use the internet, then everyone has to have it,” Mfocwa said.
			</p>

			<p>
				This sentiment is shared among many working in South African media. Paula Fray, CEO of FrayIntermedia, a media strategy and production group based in Johannesburg, said many South Africans find ways to access data-heavy content, although they often do not download it directly, from government-sponsored public WiFi.
			</p>

			<p>
				“People do in fact consume video, and they do consume products that are slightly more data heavy, but very often they share offline, sharing with Bluetooth or with Android products,” Fray said. “One person in the house has a phone, and they download [a video] and then they share it offline to different people.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Placing public WiFi within municipal buildings and statues in urban and rural areas has helped increase the number of South Africans connecting to the internet to about 52%, according to Fray. The connections at these stations are often slow due to the amount of people connecting to them simultaneously, but that stops no one. People will download messages and videos on WhatsApp, the most popular messaging service in the nation, and respond to them while at these stations before continuing with their days and sharing offline.

				The cheapest data bundles offered by South African telecom companies provide access to just one service or social media platform, such as WhatsApp or with low-data versions of Facebook that load no images or video. Bundling platforms in this manner creates a hierarchy problem: the more data a person has means that person has access to more information, and vice versa. This leads to a gatekeeper effect, especially with news, where many users send screenshots of headlines and stories instead of links to them. People with less internet access experience more misinformation compared to those with greater access, Noxolo Mfocwa of amandla.mobi said, because people with greater access have the ability to verify the claims on other sites.
			</p>

			<p>
				One group is attempting to mitigate the spread of misinformation in a data-friendly manner. Africa Check is a fact-checking organization aimed at increasing media literacy in South Africa. They produce a short, bi-monthly podcast called <a href="https://www.whatscrap.africa/">“Whats Crap on WhatsApp,”</a> a show dedicated to debunking misinformation that spreads on the platform that is also primarily distributed on the platform. The group operates a dedicated WhatsApp number for listeners to send claims to be fact checked, and the three or four most common claims, or any claims Africa Check feels need to be debunked, are featured on the next show.
			</p>

			<p>
				Cayley Clifford, a researcher at Africa Check, said the fact checking is a challenge because of the closed-circuit nature of WhatsApp groups.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Unless someone sends us a screenshot of a message that they receive, or they forward us a message, we don't actually know what information is spreading on the platform,” Clifford said. “The other thing is that because it's such a personal form of communication, people almost have this tendency to believe what they get sent on WhatsApp. On Facebook or on Twitter, you're conversing with strangers and you might be more likely to pull the person out and say, ‘Hey, this looks like crap.’ But on WhatsApp, you speak to your mom or you speak to your work colleagues or friends, and there's almost this tendency to believe that it’s true.”
			</p>

			<p>
				“What’s Crap on WhatsApp?” is purposefully kept short, in part for audience interest but also out of data usage concerns. The podcast is sent to subscribers as a five minute audio message, which keeps each episode at a data-light 7 megabytes per download. People sign up to be added to a WhatsApp broadcast list, similar to a large group message, and are sent the podcast whenever a new episode is produced.
			</p>

			<p>
				The podcast currently has around 1,800 subscribers and grows by about 20 new subscribers per week, according to Clifford.
			</p>

			<p>
				The high cost of data has altered the media landscape in the Rainbow Nation, from production to consumption. New questions will surely be raised as solutions are found. But for people like Noxolo Mfocwa, the Vodacom announcement is a small victory in the good fight for empowering the nation’s most digitally disenfranchised.
